      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>Im Stefano, A proffesional at whatever I want. I am a multiple world record holder from things like <a href="strongest.html">"Heaviest Deadlift"</a>(scroll down to World Records) to <a href="females.html">"Most sexual partners"</a>. I am a man of many, dare I say all talents. After reading all of that you are probably thinking <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">"damn, he is so much better than me at anything and everything what's the point in living my worthless life"</a> but fret not I was once also a loser like you. I am only as great as I am today because I made a deal with the devil, and lets just say I was on the bad end of the deal. So lets just say you will never be as good as me but you can try to become the best you. </p>
